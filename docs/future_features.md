## Context-Aware Conditional Tasks

**Problem**: Users often want to create tasks that depend on external conditions:
- Weather forecasts ("If it rains tomorrow, remind Joel to cover equipment")
- Equipment status ("If generator oil is low, schedule maintenance")
- Market conditions ("If bitcoin price drops below X, check mining profitability")

**Solution Ideas**:
1. **Integration Layer**: Add support for external API calls
   - Weather APIs for location-based conditions
   - Equipment telemetry APIs
   - Market data feeds

2. **Conditional Task Schema**: Extend JSON schema to support:
   ```json
   {
     "task": "Cover equipment at Site A",
     "condition": {
       "type": "weather",
       "check": "rain_probability > 50",
       "location": "Site A",
       "timeframe": "tomorrow"
     },
     "fallback_task": "Regular inspection at 9am"
   }
   ```

3. **Smart Dependencies**: Tasks that trigger based on:
   - Previous task completion status
   - External data thresholds
   - Time-based conditions with external validation

**Implementation Notes**:
- Would require significant architecture changes
- Need to handle API failures gracefully
- Security considerations for API credentials
- Rate limiting and caching strategies

**Priority**: Low (Phase 5+)
**Complexity**: High
**Value**: Medium-High for specific use cases
