## Development Principles

1. **Each phase must work standalone** - No phase depends on future phases to deliver value
2. **User feedback drives priorities** - Roadmap can be adjusted based on real usage
3. **Technical debt is paid regularly** - 20% of each phase dedicated to improvements
4. **Security and privacy by design** - Every phase includes security review
5. **Documentation is part of delivery** - Each phase includes user and technical docs

## Risk Mitigation

- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries with defined deliverables
- **Technical Complexity**: Proof of concept for each major feature
- **User Adoption**: Beta testing with real users each phase
- **Scalability**: Performance testing at each phase
- **Data Loss**: Backup and recovery testing throughout
