### 🔧 Technical Implementation

1. **Voice Processing Pipeline**
   ```python
   async def handle_voice_message(update, context):
       # Download voice file
       voice_file = await download_voice(update.message.voice)
       
       # Convert to text using OpenAI Whisper
       transcript = await speech_to_text(voice_file)
       
       # Show confirmation with options
       await show_voice_confirmation(update, transcript)
   ```

2. **Query Understanding**
   ```python
   class QueryParser:
       def parse(self, query: str) -> QueryIntent:
           # Detect query type
           if "today" in query:
               return TodayTasksQuery()
           elif "overdue" in query:
               return OverdueTasksQuery()
           elif "complete" in query:
               return CompletedTasksQuery()
   ```

3. **Inline Keyboard Builder**
   ```python
   def build_task_keyboard(task):
       keyboard = [
           [
               InlineKeyboardButton("✅ Complete", 
                                  callback_data=f"complete_{task.id}"),
               InlineKeyboardButton("📝 Edit", 
                                  callback_data=f"edit_{task.id}")
           ],
           [
               InlineKeyboardButton("🔄 Reschedule", 
                                  callback_data=f"reschedule_{task.id}"),
               InlineKeyboardButton("💬 Comment", 
                                  callback_data=f"comment_{task.id}")
           ]
       ]
       return InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard)
   ```
